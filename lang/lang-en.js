    aboutText: "Hi! I'm Kamil Sajdera, a young front-end developer who doesn’t just write code – I understand why I write it. I don’t have a stack of certificates or a corporate background, but I do have something way more valuable: pure drive, passion, and hundreds of hours of self-taught coding and building real projects. I learn fast, act consistently, and always focus on finding solutions – not excuses. I started with C++ and game plugins because I wanted to understand how things work from the inside. Then I discovered front-end development and have stuck with it ever since. With a mix of analytical thinking, a good eye for detail, and a creative spark, I aim to bring value to every project I touch. I work independently, communicate clearly, and always aim to improve. As a Junior, I ask a lot of questions because I believe that properly understanding the problem is a key feature on the way to achieving the best solution. Outside the screen, I play drums, bass guitar, and saxophone, produce music, and hit the volleyball court – because rhythm and energy matter in code and in life too.",

    skillsText1: "I write code that is not only esthetic and well-organized, but above all -accessible to everyone. I use WCAG rules, I take care of semantic HTML, appropriate color's contrast and keyboard navigation. I strive to ensure that every user - regardless of device or limitations - can use the application comfortably.",
    skillsText2: "I constantly follow trends in front-end. I use React (with hooks and functional components), NextJS (FullStack applications), SASS and Vite/Webpack. I have experience with TypeScript and can write fully typed components. I strive for my code to be scalable and easy to maintain.",
    skillsText3: "I design and implement interfaces that work smoothly on any device – from phones to ultrawide monitors. At every stage of the project, I pay attention to the correct accessibility of elements on different devices. I pay attention to the micro-details of UX, animations, speed of interaction and ergonomics.",
    skillsText4: "As a multi-month website's admin based on the IPS 4.x content management system, I took care of the proper functioning and security of the site. I made modifications and implemented user suggestions. I am well versed in the topic of downloading/modifying data in databases and working with phpmyadmin.",
    skillsText5: "Collaboration is key. I thrive in development teams, I use GIT, I value clear commits, communication, and joint problem solving.",
    skillsText6: "I have a strong sense of aesthetics and attention to detail. I can refine interfaces to make them not only functional but also visually appealing. I pay close attention to spacing, colors, typography, and visual hierarchy.",
    projectText1: "A project simulating an 'organizer' thanks to which you keep your events, expenses and to-dos in one place.",
    projectText2: "A tool for creating sheet music ready for printing, with the ability to listen to the written melody line at any tempo.",
    projectText3: "The fast food restaurant app has a variety of customizable items to eat, sizes or toppings for each one.",
    projectText4: "Search, find and discover interesting movies, tv series and people related to cinema. Thanks to a clear interface, move very smoothly into page. You can check a lot of details. Data is fetching from an external API and prepared appropriately.",

    htmlSkillsText: `I can design website structures using <b>semantic HTML elements</b>, which not only improves the readability of the code, but also has a positive effect on the website's accessibility and positioning in search results. I have experience in creating HTML forms using various field types and handling client-side validation using HTML5 attributes such as <i>required</i> and <i>pattern</i>. <br /> <br />
    I can use a variety of CSS selectors, including class and ID selectors, as well as pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, to precisely style elements on a page. I have deep knowledge of <b>flexbox</b> and <b>grid layout</b>, which allows me to design flexible and responsive website layouts that scale perfectly on various devices. I have experience in working with CSS preprocessors such as <b>SASS</b> and <b>LESS</b>, which allows me to more conveniently manage style using variables, mixins and functions.`,
    jsSkillsText: `I am skilled in manipulating the DOM tree using JavaScript, which allows me to dynamically add, remove and modify elements on the page depending on user actions. I am familiar with <b>asynchrony concepts</b> in JavaScript such as <i>Callbacks</i>, <i>Promises</i> and <i>Async/Await</i>, which allows me to handle operations that require time-consuming data downloading from external sources (API). I know concepts such as primitive/complex types, event loop, destructuring, spread operator and scope. <br /> <br />
    I have also made several projects in jQuery, so I can confidently say that it is not a problem for me. I can animate jQuery applications with smooth transitions, size changes, and the appearance of elements, which results in a more attractive website. I can use various events and respond to user interactions in an efficient and clear way. I can integrate and customize jQuery plugins, using ready-made solutions available in this library's ecosystem.`,
    reactSkillsText: `React is definitely the environment in which I write best. I can manage state in local and global (<b>Context API, Redux</b>) and respond to user interactions using event handling functions, I understand the life cycle of components.
    I can manage forms, authorize users and create my own custom hooks. I am able to optimize my React application, for example through <i>useMemo, useCallback</i> or <i>lazy loading</i>. <br />
    I successfully write applications using React Router using its hooks such as useNavigate, useNavigation, useFetcher, useParams, useSearchParams, useLocation, useSubmit and use(Route)LoaderData.
    I know various ways and approaches to communicate with the server (including <b>Tanstack Query</b>), which allows me to manage data asynchronously and update the UI based on the response from the server. I always ensure a good 'loading state' and an appropriate 'error state'.`,
